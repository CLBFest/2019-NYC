This meetup on Friday evening, March 29th and all-day Saturday, March 30th is the NYC node of the 2019 Computational Law & Blockchain Festival (global hashtag #clbfest2019 and local hashtag: #clbfest2019nyc).

This event at the Bushwick Generator is part of a month-long global event series bringing together coders, designers, lawyers, policymakers, researchers, and students to co-create the future of law, legal practice, and policy.

# Working Agenda

-------------------------------------

## FRIDAY, MARCH 19th

### 6:00 PM - 9:00 PM	Optional Pre-Event Brainstorming
* Join Emerick Patterson (Bushwick Generator) for an optional pre-event brainstorming session at our event venue, the Bushwick Generator!

* Session Description: 
> In preparation for our Computational Law & Blockchain hackathon taking place on March 30th (http://meetu.ps/e/GkKMx/1fg2s/a ), we wanted to set context the night before. Come join us and hear from niche legal experts who will share their digital innovations and insights, as well as discuss legal frameworks for the Bushwick Generator and for Brooklyn.
> This will be a robust conversation that will lay the foundation for a new, more fluid form of collaboration, team formation and ideally, economic growth.
> What we are about: We want to give #buidlers the opportunity co-create this future together and crystallize Bushwick as the ultimate experimental blockchain playground.
> Come hear first hand how the Bushwick Generator, a 100,000 sq. ft. creative campus is committed to a crypto-savvy Bushwick.
