# Automated and Autonomous Valid Legal Entities

Here is a short description of the topics I’d like to address: 

How can a software based system constitute a valid legal entity under existing law and legal processes?  

If humans are “in-the-loop” for key approvals, decisions or other actions, what aspects of the entity could or should be achieved through automated processes?  Could or should a totally automated legal entity also operate autonomously, without human reviews or approvals of important decisions or actions?  

How would such software need to operate?  What functions must it perform and what requirements or constraints would be necessary in order for the digital networked entity to be a valid legal entity?  Is it sufficient for the software to create and manage the legal entity or is there a particular benefit for the software to literally and formally be deemed a legal entity in it’s own right?  

Another way to approach this is to ask what inputs, processes and outputs of software would be needed to create and operate a valid corporation or LLC under the law and administrative processes of at least one state of the United States?  More specifically, how could such a system receive a federal and state tax identifier for the legal entity and how could it receive, accurately parse and correctly respond to legal notices from the key regulators (eg Secretary of State corporations division, tax authorities, etc)? Moreover, how could the design of such an automated or autonomous system cause a legal entity that can form, execute and enforce a legal contracts and can hire an independent contractor?  

As a rapid legal design exercise, try to identify the roles and actions assumed or required by one or more human persons vis-a-vis the software system. Must there be one or more humans in the role of incorporator, governance, executive or other management roles in order to approve or trigger certain events and other activities?  Is it sufficient for humans to play the role of agent or employee of a software based legal entity in order for that entity to be valid and operate effectively?
